      ************************************STRING****************************************
	  1.String is non-primitive Data-type.
	  2.String is the sequence of character.(Array of character)
	    eg. char[] c={'d','e','b','g','h'}
			String s=new String (c);//Interface (CharSequence)
			
	  3. String is a Class.
		
		public final class String extends Object implements CharSequence,comparable,Serialized.
		{
		  ....Object is a parent class of String.
		  ....
		  
		  
		}
		
	4.String s= new string ();
	 String is an immutable object.
	
	5.To create String there are 3 Classes
	...String
	...StringBuffer
	...StringBuilder
	
	There are five different type of Memory Areas
		...Method Area
		...Heap Area(SCP)String Constant pool
		...Stack Area
		...PC Register
		...Native Method Area
							
	6.	Different type of constructor in String
	..public String()
	..public String (String s)
	..public String (String Buffer 	sb)
	..public String(StringBuilder sb)
    ..public String (char[] ch)
    ..public String (byte[] b)
    	.....
		
	7.StringBuffer and StringBuilder are mutable but the String is Immutable.
    8.Why char array is preferred over String for storing password.
    In String the obect never get deleted it always there in SCP therefore someone should hack the passoword.
    another reason is char array should only print object outsides values it doesnot print any value inside the char array.But String should print the value.
